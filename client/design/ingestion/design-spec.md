# Ingestion — Week 4 UI design specification

Owner: Văn Hoàng (`Vcoch27`). Status: **conditional review prototype**, not an approved PRD or production implementation. Baseline: monorepo `24fe887` after foundation PRs client #10 / monorepo #6 were merged. Editable source: [prototype](prototype/index.html); visual evidence: [screenshots](screenshots/intake-1280.png).

## Scope and design direction

Translate [the Ingestion PRD](../../tasks/ingestion/prd-ingestion-ui.md) into an inspectable evidence → survey → interests → review journey. Follow [DESIGN.md](../../DESIGN.md), [guardrails](../../DESIGN-GUARDRAILS.md) and [shared tokens](../shared/tokens.css). Do not alter Analytics, Advisor, scoring policy or production routes.

Use the existing dark/indigo identity, solid surfaces and one primary action. The user selected [visual option 1](references/selected-option-1.png) on 2026-09-15, replacing the slogan sidebar and enclosing card with horizontal progress and an open 800px task column inside the 1120px shell. At widths below 700px, retain all four progress labels and a single task column. Ten survey answers remain split into two pages of five, with no default neutral response.

Typography: Segoe UI/system sans supports Vietnamese without remote font requests; headings 38px/600 desktop, 28px mobile, body 16px, choice titles 20px desktop/16px mobile. Survey prompts use regular weight rather than blanket bold. Preserve shared indigo and semantic feedback colors. Module-only `--ing-divider` is a subdued blend for non-interactive separators, not control boundaries; `--ing-selected` is an indigo selection tint. Control borders keep high contrast. No gradients, glows or new typeface dependency.

Lucide file-text and compass geometry comes from release 0.447.0, with license in prototype/LUCIDE-LICENSE.txt, matching the production icon family. The concept's account icon and feedback link are omitted because they are outside the PRD. The action row stays aligned to the form for reliable zoom reflow. These are documented refinements, not pixel-exact reproduction claims. Technical JSON stays collapsed; learner copy no longer exposes internal XD-01/DERIVED jargon. Original disclaimer and business gates remain intact.

The banner labels every screen as a design/demo. Journey labels for Analytics and Advisor are context, not functional navigation. No real Figma file was authored; editable HTML/CSS/ES modules are the design source, PNGs are review evidence, JSON is generated verification output.

## Screen, state and requirement mapping

Story identifiers below abbreviate `VH-W4-US-*`; acceptance identifiers abbreviate `ING-UI-AC-*`. These mappings describe prototype coverage, **not passing production acceptance tests**.

| Screen/state | Story / acceptance | Fixture or interaction | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Empty intake / explicit path | US-01, AC-04/08 | No selected path; Next disabled; choose record or survey-only | [Desktop](screenshots/intake-1280.png), [tablet](screenshots/intake-768.png), [mobile](screenshots/intake-375.png) |
| PDF preflight | US-02, AC-01/02 | Exactly 10,485,760 bytes accepted; max+1, zero, MIME, extension and header rejected | [Model tests](verification/model.test.mjs), [browser checks](verification/browser-check.cjs) |
| Processing / success illustration | US-03, AC-07 | Explicit synthetic-file action, cancellable generation; no real extraction | [Processing](screenshots/processing-1280.png), [success](screenshots/success-375.png) |
| Missing/partial academic evidence | US-01/03, AC-04 | No inferred GPA, courses or skills; choose another file or survey-only | [Partial](screenshots/partial-375.png) |
| File error, timeout, rate limit, schema mismatch | US-03/06, AC-06/07 | Inspector fixtures; retry is explicit; 429 waits 5 seconds, no autoretry | [415](screenshots/error-375.png), [timeout](screenshots/timeout-1280.png), [429](screenshots/rate-1280.png), [schema](screenshots/schema-1280.png) |
| Cancel / replace | US-03, AC-07 | Cancel then late sample completion; replace while processing | [Cancelled](screenshots/cancelled-1280.png), browser assertions |
| Ten independent answers | US-04, AC-03/08 | q1=1 and q2=5 retained independently; unanswered is not 3 | [Survey](screenshots/survey-375.png), model group-mean fixture |
| One to five unique interests | US-05, AC-05 | Reject sixth selection; removing one permits another | [Interests](screenshots/interests-375.png) |
| Review and error recovery | US-06, AC-04/06 | Preserve all selected tags; error stays error; explicit demo action | [Review](screenshots/review-1280.png), [error](screenshots/analysis-error-375.png) |
| Handoff boundary | US-06, XUI-AC-01/02/04 | Immutable local snapshot, DEMO origin, profile null, no automatic roadmap | [Handoff](screenshots/handoff-1280.png), model/browser assertions |
| Reflow / focus / preferences | AC-08, XUI-AC-06 | 375/768/1280, skip link, focus on stage heading, 200% CSS zoom, forced colors, reduced motion | [Zoom](screenshots/zoom-200.png), [forced colors](screenshots/forced-colors-375.png), [results](verification/results.json) |

400/413/422/5xx should reuse the actionable error layout with the actual server reason, preserved input and explicit retry; they are not separately rendered server-response fixtures here. Local oversize rejection is tested, but is not a live HTTP 413 test. Field errors use text as well as color; dynamic file errors are alerts and stage updates are status messages. Actual screen-reader speech and live error-focus behavior require integration review.

## Conditional decisions — PRD §18 remains authoritative

The numbers below reference the existing questions; no owner approval is implied.

| Question | Review variant illustrated | Decision still required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Q1 evidence path | Explicit two-radio choice; no silent default | Owner/Tech Lead may instead approve optional PDF within one flow |
| Q2 document type | Combined transcript/CV entry | Confirm whether backend requires a separate `document_type` choice before implementing the adapter |
| Q3 parsed-field correction | Synthetic success/partial status, no editable course/GPA fields | Decide fields and correction provenance before designing an authoritative editor |
| Q4 privacy wording | Exact prototype fact: no upload; local metadata/header validation only | Approve production wording after verifying actual processing/retention boundaries; do not reuse the prototype promise for production |
| Q5 multiple tags | Preserve all selected IDs without calculating a ranking | Approve combined ranking versus separate comparisons; downstream owners must not collapse to the first tag |
| Q6 neutral answers | Five native radio values, initially unanswered | Approve this alternative to sliders; explicit selection of 3 is distinguishable from no answer |
| Q7 survey/version | Existing questions/group means, exploration disclaimer | Domain owner approves scoring version and disclaimer; this is not a validated psychological test |
| Q8 persistence | In-memory only; back within the prototype retains inputs; refresh clears them | Approve storage/expiry before production persistence; no localStorage added |
| Q9 outcome measure | No fabricated success rate or research result | Owner defines metric and evaluation plan |

## State and cross-module contract

- File generation increments on cancellation, replacement or path change; old asynchronous sample callbacks cannot commit. Analysis generation increments on edits/back/cancel. Only the current local snapshot may finish.
- Real file handling reads five header bytes plus metadata, not PDF contents for extraction. The browser validator is a UX preflight, not a security boundary; server validation remains required.
- Every payload is explicitly `prototype: true`, `origin: DEMO`. `profile` is null even on the record-backed review path because no real academic extraction takes place. Synthetic success is an illustration, not an extracted record.
- The handoff object is a review fixture, **not an approved API DTO**. It preserves answers, derived interest groups and all selected tag IDs. It must not be wired directly into the live store/API.
- Analytics owns partial evidence and ranking presentation; Advisor owns prerequisites, semester/course readiness and SSE behavior. Interest-only entry does not automatically satisfy Advisor context (XD-01). No readiness score, roadmap or chat is fabricated here.
- Live/prototype provenance, shared invalidation and downstream routing are specified boundaries only. This isolated design cannot verify Zustand, live API/SSE or cross-route cache behavior.

## Handoff and remaining gates

See [review](review.md) and [verification instructions](verification/README.md). Approve the conditional choices with module owners before production implementation; retain PRD status until that approval is recorded. Then map tokens/components to the actual app, implement the agreed DTO and run integration/accessibility tests. This branch is for paired design PR review, not automatic merge.
